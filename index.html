        <h2>Study Schedule</h2>
        <p>Trybe schedule normally goes on from 2pm, ultil 8pm, from monday to friday. Its a substancial amount of time, and I try to totally focus on what the course has to offer, during this time.</p>
        <p>Normally I wake up at 8am, and try to do my asynchronous study during this time. I study again the themes of the last lecture, and do some personal research on internet about sections that were not clear, or which I deside to go a little deeper.</p>

      <h2>Learning Process</h2>
      <p>My learning process on Trybe school has been one of the things that I am most proud of, in my recent life. It all began in the preparation to the selective process. It was not easy, and know that there were manu other people trying to reach the same objective than me was a bit scary, but at the same time, very motivating to keep the focus and study harder. When I received the news that I had passed, it was very meaningful, and a really happy moment. When the course began, I was really nervous, specially in the beginning, because, despite all my passion for technology and programming, I am very unexperienced, and had never programmed before the course. It was very pleasant and confortable to see that the institution offers many tools, to help upgrade my skills and break the initial barrier that I had with computer science. The first contact was amazing. The welcome days served very well to put me integrated with the course parameters, like vision and mission, and get very excited to put all my effort on my studies along it. I consider myself a person who learns easily new things, and always liked to search by myself for informations that I think will help me solving problems and learn new things, I consider that these characteristics helped me through my days in here, as well. I know that it is just the beginning, and the things will become more complex, but I am sure that with the hekp of Trybe and my colleagues, we all will pass the dificulties and become really good software developers. These are some thoughts about my learning process, and I hope to continue the course, learn as much as I can and, together with Trybe, start building a solid career in this area.
